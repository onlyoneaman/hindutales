    "In the vast forests of Hastinapura, a young Nishada prince named Ekalavya longed to learn the art of archery from Guru Dronacharya.",
    "Ekalavya approached Dronacharya, expressing his desire to become his disciple, but the Guru refused due to Ekalavya's non-royal lineage.",
    "Determined, Ekalavya sculpted a statue of Dronacharya from clay, revering it as his teacher, and began practicing archery diligently.",
    "Through unwavering dedication, Ekalavya mastered archery, becoming an exceptional marksman guided by his devotion to the clay statue.",
    "One day, while in the forest, Dronacharya encountered Ekalavya and witnessed his unparalleled archery skills.",
    "Impressed yet cautious, Dronacharya requested Ekalavya to offer his right thumb as 'Guru Dakshina' to prevent rivalry with royal disciples.",
    "Without hesitation, Ekalavya severed his thumb, demonstrating ultimate respect and sacrifice for his Guru's wishes.",
    "Ekalavya's story stands as a testament to devotion, selflessness, and the power of determination, inspiring generations to come."

    "A determined Hiranyakashipu, a powerful demon king, is depicted meditating intensely under a large banyan tree, seeking invincibility from Lord Brahma. The scene is set in a tranquil forest with soft light filtering through the dense canopy. Hiranyakashipu's posture is cross-legged, his eyes closed in deep concentration, and his body radiating a fiery aura that signifies his intense penance.",
    "Prahlad, a young and devout boy, is shown kneeling with folded hands in prayer to Lord Vishnu. He is inside a grand yet oppressive palace, with luxurious yet dark interiors reflecting his father's tyranny. Prahlad's expression is serene and full of devotion, while a soft golden light emanates around him, symbolizing his divine connection.",
    "Prahlad is depicted in the midst of a trial orchestrated by his father Hiranyakashipu. He stands unharmed and calm in a pit of fire, his hands clasped in prayer. The fire surrounds him but does not touch him, and his expression exudes unwavering faith. The scene is dramatic with the contrast of the roaring flames and the tranquil figure of Prahlad.",
    "The dramatic climax shows Lord Narasimha, half-man, half-lion, emerging from a grand palace pillar. Narasimha is fierce and divine, his golden mane flowing as he displays his power. He holds the tyrannical Hiranyakashipu in his lap, ready to end his reign of terror. The scene is illuminated by a radiant divine light, symbolizing justice and the restoration of dharma."

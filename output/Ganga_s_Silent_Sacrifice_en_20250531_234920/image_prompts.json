    "Depict Ganga, the river goddess, standing gracefully by the flowing river she embodies. Her appearance is serene and divine, with soft blue skin and large, expressive eyes radiating calm. She is adorned in a white saree with golden embroidery, symbolizing purity, and wears ornate jewelry with gemstones. Her posture is poised, with one hand raised in blessing and the other holding a lotus flower. The background showcases a tranquil riverscape under a twilight sky, with soft colors blending into a harmonious palette.",
    "Illustrate Ganga cradling a newborn baby in her arms as she wades into the river. Her expression is a mix of maternal warmth and sorrow, her eyes glistening. The baby is wrapped in a golden cloth, radiant against Gangaâ€™s white attire. The river sparkles gently around them, reflecting the soft glow of the setting sun. The mood is poignant, emphasizing the sanctity and gravity of her actions.",
    "Show King Shantanu standing at the riverbank, looking toward Ganga with a mix of confusion and awe. He is dressed in royal attire with a golden crown, his posture upright and regal. Ganga is partially submerged in the river, her form ethereal and glowing, with her hands clasped in prayer. The atmosphere is misty, with soft light highlighting the scene's divine and mystical nature.",
    "Create an image of Ganga in her celestial form, ascending into the heavens. She is surrounded by a soft golden glow, her saree flowing as if caught in a gentle breeze. Her expression is peaceful, her eyes closed in quiet resolution. Around her, celestial beings and symbols, such as floating lotuses and glowing auras, enhance the divine atmosphere. The background is filled with soft clouds, bathed in hues of gold and pink."

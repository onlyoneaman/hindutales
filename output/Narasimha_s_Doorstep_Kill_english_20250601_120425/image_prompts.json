    "A majestic scene of Hiranyakashipu, the powerful Asura king, standing tall before Brahma. Hiranyakashipu is dressed in royal Asura attire with intricate golden ornaments, his expression determined and calculated as he petitions Brahma. Brahma, seated on a lotus, radiates divine calmness, his four faces serene and wise, granting the boon. The background features a celestial landscape with a glowing aura, emphasizing the divine interaction."

    "Brahma, the creator, is approached by Hiranyakashipu, a mighty Asura king. With unmatched intellect, Hiranyakashipu requests immortality—not through direct means, but by conditions: no death by man or beast, no demise indoors or outdoors, not at day nor night. Brahma grants the boon, sealing Hiranyakashipu’s fate.",
    "Despite Hiranyakashipu’s domination, his son Prahlada grows devoted to Lord Vishnu, the preserver of dharma. With unwavering faith, the child prays and teaches others about Vishnu’s virtues, angering his father, who forbids such devotion. But Prahlada’s steadfastness remains unshaken.",
    "Furious at his son’s defiance, Hiranyakashipu challenges Prahlada’s beliefs, mocking Vishnu’s power. He asks, ‘If Vishnu is omnipresent, is he within this pillar?’ With rage, he strikes the column, calling Vishnu to prove himself, unaware of the divine plan unfolding.",
    "The pillar splits open, revealing Narasimha—a form neither man nor beast, lion-faced and human-bodied. Narasimha, an incarnation of Vishnu, emerges to honor Prahlada’s faith and the boon’s conditions, bringing divine power and justice into the world.",
    "Twilight descends. Narasimha seizes Hiranyakashipu, places him at the palace’s threshold—not indoors nor outdoors—and tears him apart with bare claws, fulfilling every condition of Brahma’s boon. Justice is delivered; dharma restored. Prahlada’s devotion is vindicated."

    "Depict the serene setting of Panchavati, where Rama, Sita, and Lakshmana are living during their exile. The image should show the modest hermitage surrounded by lush forests and peaceful rivers. Rama and Sita should be seated outside the hut, with Lakshmana standing nearby, holding a bow. The atmosphere should feel tranquil, with vibrant greenery and soft sunlight filtering through the trees.",
    "Illustrate Maricha transformed into a golden deer, as instructed by Ravana. The deer should be dazzling and mesmerizing, with golden fur that glimmers in the light. It is positioned slightly away from the hermitage, visible to Sita, who looks at it with awe and wonder. The setting remains within the forest environment, with natural elements blending harmoniously with the magical aura of the deer.",
    "Show Sita admiring the golden deer with an expression of enchantment and longing. She should be gesturing to Rama, who listens attentively to her request to capture it. Rama is prepared with his bow, standing determined, while the deer stands in the distance, seemingly inviting pursuit. The scene takes place just outside their hermitage.",
    "Illustrate Lakshmana reluctantly leaving the hermitage upon Sita's insistence. Sita should be portrayed with a worried yet commanding expression, urging Lakshmana to follow Rama. Lakshmana looks hesitant but determined as he steps away from the hut, holding his bow and glancing back at Sita.",
    "Depict Ravana disguised as a hermit approaching Sita. Sita is seated near the hermitage, looking somewhat skeptical and cautious. Ravana, in his mendicant disguise, should appear harmless yet subtly sinister. The forest setting is serene but begins to hint at a foreboding atmosphere.",
    "Show Sita being carried away by Ravana, who has revealed his true form. Sita struggles, her expressions showing resistance and defiance. Jewelry pieces fall from her grasp, scattered along the path as clues. Ravana, depicted as imposing and fierce, carries Sita through the air, while the forest below looks dark and ominous."

    "Depict the scene where Brahma creates Ahalya, showcasing her ethereal beauty and divine origins. Brahma, a serene figure with four faces and golden attire, is seen crafting a radiant figure of Ahalya, who appears otherworldly beautiful with glowing skin and adorned in celestial jewelry. The setting is a divine realm with golden clouds and lotus flowers, bathed in soft, divine light.",
    "Show the moment where Indra, disguised as sage Gautama, approaches Ahalya. Indra should be wearing a simple sage's robe but with a sly expression, while Ahalya is seen in a calm and trusting demeanor. The setting should be a peaceful hermitage surrounded by lush greenery, with a warm and tranquil atmosphere.",
    "Illustrate sage Gautama’s wrathful moment as he discovers the deception. Gautama, a stern and imposing figure with his staff, should have an expression of righteous fury, while Ahalya looks shocked and remorseful. The background is the modest hermitage, with an intense and somber mood highlighted by overcast lighting.",
    "Capture the serene scene of Ahalya’s redemption. Lord Rama, a youthful and divine figure in royal attire, gently touches a stone, which transforms into Ahalya, her expression filled with gratitude and reverence. The setting is a tranquil forest with soft sunlight filtering through the trees, symbolizing renewal and grace.",
    "Portray the final moment where Ahalya stands before Rama, her hands folded in gratitude, and Rama blesses her with a serene and compassionate expression. The setting is the same forest clearing, now imbued with a golden glow, symbolizing the divine resolution and the restoration of dharma."

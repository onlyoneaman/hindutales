    "Depict Sita standing serenely within a blazing fire, her expression calm and dignified, symbolizing her purity. Sita wears a flowing saree in golden hues, adorned with intricate patterns. Her hands are folded in front of her in a gesture of prayer. The flames envelop her gently, creating a divine aura. The background is a simple forest clearing with Ram and Lakshman watching solemnly at a respectful distance. The atmosphere is reverent and mystical.",
    "Illustrate Lord Rama gazing at Sita with a mixture of sorrow and determination, standing beside the sacred fire. Rama is dressed in royal attire, featuring a dhoti and angavastram in saffron and green tones, with a jeweled crown. His posture is upright, his face reflecting inner conflict. The setting is the forest with the fire illuminating the scene, adding a sense of drama and divinity.",
    "Show Lakshman reluctantly lighting the fire for Sita's Agni Pariksha, his expression filled with anguish and hesitation. Lakshman is dressed in warrior attire with a simple dhoti and an angavastram, adorned minimally with ornaments. He holds a torch, leaning slightly toward the fire pit, while his other hand is raised as if stopping himself. The backdrop is the forest, with the fire gradually building up, casting warm light and shadows.",
    "Create an image of Agni, the fire god, emerging from the flames to affirm Sita's purity. Agni is depicted with a golden complexion, wearing a crown of flames and a flowing garment resembling fire. His hands are raised in blessing, and his expression is serene yet powerful. Sita stands nearby, her expression radiant and calm, while Rama and Lakshman watch in awe. The fiery backdrop has divine golden and red tones, radiating warmth and divinity."

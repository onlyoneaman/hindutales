Common Meta-Styling Guide Image generation:

This document serves as a comprehensive meta-styling guide for all AI-generated artwork in the Hindu mythology art app. The goal is to ensure a consistent, visually cohesive, and culturally respectful art style across all images, adopting a cartoon-like, soft-anime aesthetic. This style guide must be embedded in all prompts for image generation to maintain uniformity in visual tone, character design, environments, and thematic elements. Below are the detailed specifications for the art style.

1. Art Style Overview
- Primary Aesthetic: Cartoon-like with a soft-anime influence, blending vibrant, expressive visuals with gentle, approachable character designs.
- Tone and Mood: Reverent yet accessible, capturing the divine and mystical essence of Hindu mythology while maintaining a warm, inviting feel suitable for all ages.
- Inspiration: Draws from traditional Indian miniature paintings, Amar Chitra Katha comics, and soft-anime styles (e.g., Studio Ghibli’s gentle character designs, but adapted to Hindu mythological themes).
Key Characteristics:
- Clean, smooth lines with minimal harsh edges.
- Vibrant yet harmonious color palettes rooted in Indian cultural aesthetics.
- Exaggerated expressions and poses to convey emotion and divinity, but with a softness that avoids hyper-realism or overly sharp details.
- Emphasis on mythological authenticity with stylized, non-realistic proportions.



2. Character Design

Proportions:
- Slightly exaggerated features typical of cartoon/soft-anime styles: large, expressive eyes (20-30% larger than realistic proportions), small noses, and soft facial contours.
- Body proportions: Slender and elongated (e.g., 6-7 head heights for adult deities), with graceful postures reflecting divinity or heroism.
- Hands and feet are delicate, with flowing gestures to emphasize elegance and divine power.

Facial Expressions:
- Expressive yet serene, reflecting the divine nature of characters (e.g., calm benevolence for Vishnu, fierce determination for Durga, playful charm for Krishna).
- Avoid overly angular or aggressive expressions unless contextually appropriate (e.g., Kali in battle).

Attire and Accessories:
- Traditional Indian garments (e.g., sarees, dhotis, kurta) with intricate patterns inspired by Indian textiles like Banarasi silk or Rajasthani block prints.
- Ornaments: Gold and gemstone jewelry (e.g., necklaces, anklets, crowns) with detailed yet stylized designs, avoiding photorealistic textures.
- Divine attributes: Incorporate iconic elements like Vishnu’s conch, Shiva’s trident, or Ganesha’s modak, rendered in a simplified, cartoonish style.

Skin Tones:
- Use a range of warm, glowing skin tones (e.g., golden, bronze, or soft blue for deities like Krishna or Rama) to reflect divine radiance.
- Avoid hyper-realistic skin textures; use smooth, gradient shading for a soft-anime look.



3. Color Palette

Primary Colors:
- Rich, saturated hues inspired by Indian festivals and nature: saffron orange, deep red, royal blue, emerald green, and golden yellow.
- Use pastel accents (e.g., soft pink, lavender) for softer elements like auras or backgrounds to enhance the anime aesthetic.


Divine Glow:
- Incorporate subtle halos, auras, or glowing outlines around deities using warm golds or cool blues to signify divinity.
Glow effects should be soft and diffused, never harsh or neon.


Contrast and Harmony:
- High contrast between characters and backgrounds to make figures stand out, but maintain color harmony within the scene (e.g., complementary colors like blue and orange).
- Avoid overly dark or muted tones to keep the art vibrant and approachable.



4. Backgrounds and Environments

Setting Inspiration:
- Draw from Hindu mythological locales: lush forests (e.g., Vrindavan for Krishna), celestial palaces, Himalayan peaks (for Shiva), or cosmic voids (for Vishnu’s cosmic forms).
- Stylize environments with soft, painterly textures and simplified details to match the cartoon aesthetic.

Elements:
- Include symbolic elements like lotuses, peacocks, rivers, or mountains, rendered in a whimsical, non-realistic style.
- Use swirling clouds, starry skies, or radiant light beams to evoke a mystical atmosphere.


Perspective and Depth:
- Employ soft-anime-style perspective with gentle vanishing points and layered backgrounds to create depth without overwhelming detail.
- Backgrounds should complement, not overshadow, the central characters.



5. Line Work and Shading

Line Work:
- Clean, smooth outlines with varying thickness (thicker for main characters, thinner for details) to emphasize hierarchy and focus.
- Avoid jagged or overly sketchy lines; prioritize fluidity and grace.


Shading:
- Use soft, gradient-based shading with minimal hard edges, inspired by cel-shading techniques in anime.
Highlights should be subtle, using white or pale pastel tones to suggest radiance.
Avoid heavy shadows or realistic lighting; keep shading minimal and stylized.



6. Cultural and Mythological Authenticity

Iconography:
- Accurately depict traditional attributes, weapons, and symbols associated with each deity or character (e.g., Lakshmi’s lotus, Hanuman’s mace).
- Reference traditional Hindu art (e.g., Tanjore paintings, temple carvings) for inspiration, but simplify details for the cartoon style.


Poses and Gestures:
- Use mudras (hand gestures) and iconic poses from Hindu iconography (e.g., Vishnu’s reclining pose on Shesha, Ganesha’s seated posture).
- Stylize poses to be dynamic yet elegant, avoiding stiff or overly realistic stances.


Respectful Representation:
- Ensure depictions are reverent and culturally sensitive, avoiding caricatures or exaggerated features that could be disrespectful.
- Consult traditional sources (e.g., Puranas, temple art) for accurate portrayals of deities, demons, and mythological scenes.



7. Technical Specifications

Resolution and Format:
- Generate images at a minimum resolution of 1920x1080 pixels for high-quality display, scalable for various app interfaces.
- Use a consistent aspect ratio (e.g., 16:9 or 4:3) to ensure uniformity across the app.


File Output:
- Images should be generated in PNG format with transparent backgrounds for flexibility in app integration.


Consistency Across Generations:
- Include this meta-styling guide in every image generation prompt to ensure the AI model adheres to the defined style.
- Use consistent seed values or style embeddings (if supported by the AI model) to maintain visual coherence.



8. Example Prompt Integration
To ensure this style guide is applied, prepend the following to every image generation prompt:
"Generate an image in a cartoon-like, soft-anime style as per the Hindu Mythology Art Style Guide. The art should feature clean lines, vibrant yet harmonious colors (saffron, red, blue, green, gold), soft shading, and expressive, slightly exaggerated features (large eyes, slender proportions). Characters should wear traditional Indian attire with simplified, intricate patterns and divine attributes (e.g., Vishnu’s conch, Shiva’s trident). Backgrounds should be mystical, inspired by Hindu mythology (e.g., forests, celestial palaces), with soft textures and symbolic elements like lotuses or peacocks. Ensure cultural authenticity and reverence, using smooth gradients, glowing auras, and dynamic yet elegant poses. Output in PNG at 1920x1080 resolution with a transparent background."

9. Additional Notes

Avoid Common Pitfalls:
- Do not use photorealistic textures, overly dark themes. Avoid generic anime tropes (e.g., spiky hair, exaggerated chibi proportions) that deviate from the soft-anime aesthetic.
